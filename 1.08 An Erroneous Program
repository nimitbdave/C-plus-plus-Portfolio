//  One compiler issued the following error message:
//  Error : ';' expected
//  Testing.cpp line 4 cout << "n = " << n << endl;

//This compiler underlines the TOKEN where it finds the error. In this case, that is the “cout” TOKEN at the
//beginning of the fourth line. The missing token was not detected until the next token was encountered.
