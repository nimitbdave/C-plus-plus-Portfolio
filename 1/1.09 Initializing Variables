#include <iostream>
using namespace std; 

int main()
{ // prints "m = ?? and n = 44":
  int m; // BAD: m is not initialized
  int n=44;
  cout << "m = " << m << " and n = " << n << endl;
}

// OUTPUT:  m = ?? and n = 44

// THIS COMPILER handles uninitialized variables in a special way. It gives them a special value that appears
// as ?? when printed. Other compilers may simply leave “GARBAGE” in the variable, producing output like this:
//  m = -2107339024 and n = 44
