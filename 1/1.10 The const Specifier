//Constants are usually defined for values like Ï€ that will be used more than once in a program but not changed.
//It is customary to use ALL CAPITAL LETTERS in constant identifiers to distinguish them from other
//kinds of identifiers. A good compiler will replace each constant symbol with its numeric value.
