/*
This run solves the equation 2x2 + 1x â€“ 3 = 0 correctly:
OUPUT 1: 
Enter the coefficients of a quadratic equation:
      a: 2
      b: 1
      c: -3
The equation is: 2*x*x + 1*x + -3 = 0
The solutions are:
      x1 = 1
      x2 = -1.5
Check:
      a*x1*x1 + b*x1 + c = 0
      a*x2*x2 + b*x2 + c = 0
      
      
But this run attempts to solve the equation x2 + 10000000000x + 1 = 0 and fails:
OUTPUT 2:  
Enter the coefficients of a quadratic equation:
      a: 1
      b: 1e10
      c: 1
The equation is: 1*x*x + 1e10*x + 1 = 0
The solutions are:
      x1 = 0
      x2 = -1e10
Check:
      a*x1*x1 + b*x1 + c = 1
      a*x2*x2 + b*x2 + c = 1
