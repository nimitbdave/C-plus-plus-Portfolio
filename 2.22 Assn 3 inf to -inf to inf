/* 
Assn:
Write and run a program to find which, if any, arithmetic operations can be applied to a variable
that will change its value from any of the three numeric constants inf, -inf, and nan
to something else.

Summary:
The following program changes the value of x from inf to -inf and vice versa. But no arithmetic
operation will change the value of a variable once it becomes nan.
