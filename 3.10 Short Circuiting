/*

In this run,d is positive and n%d is zero, so the compound condition is true:
OUPUT 1: 
Enter two positive integers: 300 6
6 divides 300

In this run, d is positive but n%d is not zero, so the compound condition is false:
OUTPUT 2:  
Enter two positive integers: 300 7
7 does not divide 300

In this run,d is zero, so the compound condition is immediately determined to be false without evaluating
the second expression “n%d == 0”:
OUTPUT 3:  
Enter two positive integers: 300 0
0 does not divide 300
