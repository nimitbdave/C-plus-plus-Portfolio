/*
OUPUT: 
Enter an integer: 0 0 1
max = 0

The source of this error is the fact that boolean expressions have numeric values. Since the expression
(n1 >= n2 >= n3) is evaluated from left to right, the first part n1 >= n2 evaluates to “true” since
0 >= 0. But “true” is stored as the numeric value 1. That value is then compared to the value of n3 which
is also 1, so the complete expression evaluates to “true” even though it is really false! (0 is not the
maximum of 0, 0, and 1.)
