/* 
First the program divides the score by 10 to reduce the range of values to 0–10. So in the test run, the
score 83 reduces to the value 8, the program execution branches to case 8, and prints the output shown.
Then the break statement causes the program execution to branch to the first statement after the switch
block. That statement prints “Goodbye.”.
Note that scores in the ranges 101 to 109 and -9 to -1 produce incorrect results.
