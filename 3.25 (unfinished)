/* 

Write and run a program that reads two integers and then uses the conditional expression
operator to print either “multiple” or “not” according to whether one of the integers is a multiple
of the other.

An integer m is a multiple of an integer n if the remainder from the integer division of m by n is 0. So
the compound condition m % n == 0 || n % m == 0 tests whether either is a multiple of the
other:

#include <cfloat>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std; 

int main()
{ int m,n;
  cin >> m >> n;
  cout << (m % n == 0 || n % m == 0 ? "multiple" : "not") << endl;  //Evaluates to "multiple" if m % n == 0 || n % m == 0 is true
                                                                    //Else cout << "not"
