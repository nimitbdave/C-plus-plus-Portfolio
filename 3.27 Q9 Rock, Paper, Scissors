/* 
Write and run a program that plays the game of “Rock, paper, scissors.” In this game, two
players simultaneously say (or display a hand symbol representing) either “rock,” “paper,” or
“scissors.” The winner is the one whose choice dominates the other. The rules are: paper
dominates (wraps) rock, rock dominates (breaks) scissors, and scissors dominate (cut) paper.
Use enumerated types for the choices and for the results.
