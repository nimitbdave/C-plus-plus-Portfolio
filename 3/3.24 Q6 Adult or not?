/* 
Write and run a program that reads the user’s age and then prints “You are a child.” if the
age < 18, “You are an adult.” if 18 ≤ age < 65, and “You are a senior citizen.” if age ≥ 65.

Here we used the else if construct because the three outcomes depend upon age being in one
of three disjoint intervals:

#include <cfloat>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std; 

int main()
{ int age;
  cout << "Enter your age: ";
  cin >> age;
  if (age < 18) 
    cout << "You are a child.\n";
  else if (age < 65) 
    cout << "You are an adult.\n";
  else 
    cout << "you are a senior citizen.\n";
}

/*
OUPUT: 
Enter your age: 44
You are an adult.


If control reaches the second condition (age < 65), then the first condition must be false so in fact
18 ≤ age < 65. Similarly, if control reaches the second else, then both conditions must be false so in
fact age ≥ 65.
