/* 
Write and run a program that simulates a simple calculator. It reads two integers and a character.
If the character is a +, the sum is printed; if it is a -, the difference is printed; if it is a *,
the product is printed; if it is a /, the quotient is printed; and if it is a %, the remainder is
printed. Use a switch statement.

The character representing the operation should be the control variable for the switch statement:
