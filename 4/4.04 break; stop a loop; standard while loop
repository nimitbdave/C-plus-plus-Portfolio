/* 
This runs the same as in 4.01: 
as soon as the value of i reaches n, 
the loop terminates and the
output statement at the end of the program executes.

Note that the control condition on the while loop itself is TRUE, 
which means continue forever. 
This is the standard way to code a while loop when it is being controlled from within.
