/* 
This program prints all the Fibonacci numbers up to an input limit.

This while loop contains a block of five statements. When the condition (f2 > bound) is
evaluated to be true, the break statement executes, terminating the loop immediately, without executing
the last three statements in that iteration.
Note the use of the newline character \n in the string ":\n0,1" . This prints the colon : at the
end of the current line, and then prints 0,1 at the beginning of the next line.
