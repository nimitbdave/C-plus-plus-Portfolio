/* 
When y > x,
the execution of the inner y loop terminates
and the next iteration of the outer x loop begins. 

For example, when x = 3, the y loop iterates 3 times (with y = 1, 2, 3), 
printing 3 6 9. 
Then on its 4th iteration, the condition (y > x) is true, so the break statement executes, transferring control
immediately to the cout << endl statement (which is outside of the inner y loop). Then the outer x
loop begins its 4th iteration with x = 4.
