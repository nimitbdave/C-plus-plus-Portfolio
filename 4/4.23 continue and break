OUPUT: 
Enter int: 7
    Bottom of loop.
Enter int: 4
Enter int: 9
    Outside of loop.
    
When n has the value 7, both if conditions are false and control reaches the bottom of the loop. When
n has the value 4, the first if condition is true (4 is a multiple of 2), so control skips over the rest of the
statements in the loop and jumps immediately to the top of the loop again to continue with its next
iteration. When n has the value 9, the first if condition is false (9 is not a multiple of 2) but the second if
condition is true (9 is a multiple of 3), so control breaks out of the loop and jumps immediately to the first
statement that follows the loop.
