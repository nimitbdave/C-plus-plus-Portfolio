/* 
Write and run a program that directly implements the quotient operator / and the remainder
operator % for the division of positive integers.

This program directly implements the quotient operator / and the remainder operator % for the
division of positive integers. The algorithm used here, applied to the fraction n/d, repeatedly subtracts
the d from the n until n is less than d. At that point, the value of n will be the remainder, and
the number q of iterations required to reach it will be the quotient:
