/* 
The two control variables m and n are declared and initialized in the control mechanism of this for
loop. Then m is decremented by 3 and n is incremented on each iteration of the loop, generating the
sequence of (m,n) pairs (95,11), (92,12), (89,13), (86,14), (83,15), (80,16). The loop terminates with the
pair (80,16) because 16 divides 80.
