/* 
Here is a simple function that prompts the user for his/her age and then returns it. It is “robust” in the
sense that it rejects any unreasonable integer input. It repeatedly requests input until it receives an integer
in the range 0 to 120.

As soon as the input received from cin is acceptable, the function terminates with a return
statement, sending the input back to the calling function. If the input is not acceptable (either n < 0or
n > 120), then the system beep is sounded by printing the character '\a' and a comment printed.
Then the user is asked to “Try again.”

Note that this is an example of a function whose return statement is not at the end of the function.
