/* 
This program defines an array high[] of seven floats, representing the high temperatures for
the seven days of a week.

The array size is SAT+1 because SAT has the integer value 6 and the array needs 7 elements.

The int variable day, declared as an index in the for loop, takes the values SUN, MON, TUE, WED,
THU, FRI, or SAT. They are actually stored as the integers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
Note that it is not possible to print the names of the symbolic constants.

The advantage of using enumeration constants this way is that they render this code
“self-documenting.” For example, the for loop control
  
  for (int day = SUN; day <= SAT; day++)

speaks for itself.

OUPUT: 
The high temperature for day 0 was 88.3
The high temperature for day 1 was 95.0
The high temperature for day 2 was 91.2
The high temperature for day 3 was 89.9

The high temperature for day 6 was 86.7


Enumeration types are one way for programmers to define their own types. For example,
  
  enum Color { RED, ORANGE, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE, VIOLET };   // Note, this corresponds to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

defines the type Color which can then be used to declare variables like this:

Color shirt = BLUE;
Color car[] = { GREEN, RED, BLUE, RED };
float wavelength[VIOLET+1] = {420, 480, 530, 570, 600, 620};   //To make 6 var's, need VIOLET + 1 (i.e., 5 + 1 = 6).  

Here, shirt is a variable whose value can be any one of the 6 values of the type Color and is initialized to have the value BLUE, 
car is an array of 4 such Color type variables indexed from 0 to 3, and 
wavelength is an array of 6 float type variables indexed from RED to VIOLET.
