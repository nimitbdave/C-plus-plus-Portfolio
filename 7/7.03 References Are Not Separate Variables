OUPUT: 
&n = 0x0064fde4,  &rn = 0x0064fde4
&rn2 = 0x0064fde4,  &rn3 = 0x0064fde4

The first line of output shows that n and rn have the same
address: 0x0064fde4. Thus they are merely different names for
the same object. 

The second line of output shows that an object can
have several references, and that a reference to a reference is the
same as a reference to the object to which it refers. In this program,
there is only one object: an int named n with address
0x0064fde4. The names rn, rn2, and rn3 are all references to
that same object.
