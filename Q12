/* 
Write and test a program that solves quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is an equation
of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are given coefficients and x is the unknown.
The coefficients are real number inputs, so they should be declared of type float or
double. Since quadratic equations typically have two solutions, use x1 and x2 for the
solutions to be output. These should be declared of type double to avoid inaccuracies from
round-off error. 


The solution(s) to the quadratic equation is given by the quadratic formula.
But this will not apply if a is zero, so that condition must be checked separately. The formula also fails
to work (for real numbers) if the expression under the square root is negative. That expression b2 +
4ac is called the discriminant of the quadratic. We define that as the separate variable d and check its
sign.

Note how we use the return statement inside the selection statements to terminate the program if
either a is zero or d is negative. The alternative would have been to use an else clause in each if
statement.
